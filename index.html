		<h1>Home On The Range</h1>
		<h2>These animals at Home On The Range are eager for a new home. Maybe one of them will be yours?</h2>
		<p>So many people love animals. Unfortunately, there are so many animals that not all of them live in the happy home that they deserve. When you adopt one of these beautiful animals, you'll be forming a bond that will last a lifetime!</p>

		<h3>Ginger</h3>

		<p>Ginger is a three year old orange tabby cat. She can be quite shy at first, but once she becomes comfortable in your presence, she'll hardly ever leave your side! She loves cuddling, being petted, playing with toys and eating treats. She can also be quite mischievous at times. Ginger will definitely keep you on your toes!</p>

		<h3>Duke</h3>

		<p>Duke is a four year old German Shepherd. Fiercely loyal, highly intelligent, and full of rambunctious energy, you'll fall in love with Duke very quickly! He is a very active dog who loves to play and go on long walks. If you aren't already leading a very active lifestyle, you certainly will when you adopt Duke. Unfortunately Duke was abused when he was a puppy, so he can be a bit shy and standoffish around strangers. However, he warms up to people very quickly!</p>
