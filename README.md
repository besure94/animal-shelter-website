# Home On The Range

#### By Brian Scherner

#### A website for an animal shelter.

## Description

This website allows users to view five animals that are up for adoption, with a description of each animal.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the middle level of the directory.
* Open index.html in your browser.

## Known Bugs

* I plan to go back and work on my columns and edit them so that the borders look less awkward. I played around a lot with variables, hovers and transitions with this project and plan to add more to them as I learn more about CSS.
